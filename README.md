# Planet Mareep
The most envied Anything Goes server.

Greetings visitor, I see you've stumbled upon the Planet Mareep repository. Previously you could locate my website at planetmareep.com but unfortunately there was an incident where that domain was taken from my possession due to conflict. Nonetheless, that's all precedent and now I shifted to GitHub pages as my substitution. 

It's a shame that GitHub does not support PHP, otherwise I would heavily utulize it. But, gotta stick with what you have to work with :P. I try not to use Javascript for anything on my website to be friendly to non-Javascript users whether they are NoScript comrades or visiting with an outdated browser, but note that may not be subsequent and likely to change near the future. 

I welcome design criticism, or code shortening. Feel free to politely tell me something I might be doing wrong and I'll regard your comment. As someone who was been writing code in HTML and CSS since 2014, I feel like I have heavily progressed over the years but still acknowledge that there are those better than me.

That's all I have to comment here, thanks for briefly reading (or skipping) through.
