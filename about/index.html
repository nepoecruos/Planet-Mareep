        	    <h2>Planet Mareep Summary</h2>
                <div class="box">
                <p>Planet Mareep is a Pok&eacute;mon-oriented server centered around competitive discussion, impartiality and socialization. Starting as a group for friends then shortly becoming an open-invite server, the server hosts weekly events such as Underrated of The Week and creating unique competitive sets for favorite metagames like Anything Goes and Cross Evolution.
<br>
<br>
The server was created on August 16th 2019 by the top ladder players of Anything Goes and Cross Evolution as a personal server and now having a website and active growing community. The motivation behind the server's creation was the underwhelming amount of good servers hence deciding to make Pok&eacute;mon servers great again.
